Enterprise Document Intelligence – RAG Chatbot

A production-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables natural language querying across multiple enterprise PDF documents without manual document selection. The system automatically retrieves relevant information from the best sources and generates grounded answers with full observability.

🚀 Features:

Multi-document semantic search across large PDFs

Automatic document selection (no file input required)

Optimized PDF ingestion and semantic chunking

FAISS-based vector search for fast retrieval

Chat-style UI with session-level memory

LangSmith observability for tracing and debugging

🧠 Problem Solved:

Enterprise documents are large, scattered, and time-consuming to search manually.
This system automates document understanding and retrieval, reducing information-search effort by ~60–70% while improving answer accuracy and traceability.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Backend: FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS

Frontend: Streamlit

LLM & Observability: Groq, LangSmith

PDF Parsing: PyMuPDF, pdfplumber
